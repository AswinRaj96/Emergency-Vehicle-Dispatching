# Emergency Vehicle Dispatching Problem.

Emergency vehicle despatching is one of the challenging problems espically in one of the busiest city like Toronto. Me and my teammates wanted to solve this problem and by using the datasets created by us from hotspots around University of Toronto and emergency vehicle locations such as police stations, fire stations around University of Toronto. We implemented a combination of graph algorithm like Djistra's and bio-insipired algorithms to come up with the solution.
