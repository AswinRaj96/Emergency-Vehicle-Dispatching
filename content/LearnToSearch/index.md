# Learn to Search

Machine learning (ML) is a subfield of AI that endows an artificial system/process with the ability to learn from experience and from observation without being explicitly programmed. ML algorithms are traditionally categorized into supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning algorithms. First, supervised learning uses inductive inference to approximate mapping functions between data and labels/classes. This mapping is learned using already labeled training data. Second, unsupervised learning deals with unlabeled data through techniques like clustering and data association. The third category of ML algorithms is reinforcement learning (RL), which is a weakly supervised learning technique that learns from interactions through a feedback loop or by trial and error. RL learns what to do (i.e., how to map a situation to actions) to maximize a numerical reward function. Deep learning (DL) is a subfield of machine learning concerned with learning of underlying features in data using deep neural networks enabling artificial systems to build complex concepts out of simpler concepts.

ML techniques can be used to search space and to solve combinatorial optimization problems on graphs. The following approaches are discussed:

- [Attention Mechanisms](AttentionMechanisms.md)
- [Reinforcement Learning](ReinforcementLearning.md)
