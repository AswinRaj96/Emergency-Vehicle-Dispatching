# Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a unique ML technique. It’s distinguishable from the other techniques for not requiring any training data nor examples, as it simply involves learning by experience.  RL is not supervised and is not unsupervised. RL is weakly supervised or semi-supervised learning paradigm. RL is learning what to do –how to map situations to actions– so as to maximize a numerical reward signal. RL features an interactive intelligent agent with an explicit goal to achieve.
