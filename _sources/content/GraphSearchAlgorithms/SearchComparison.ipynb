    "At first glance, it may seem that a Bidirectional Dijkstra is the \"best\" search algorithm, as it is both complete and optimal, as well as more space efficient than a normal Dijkstra search. However, when dealing with large datasets, space complexity is often a bigger hurdle than actual performance or guaranteeing an optimal solution.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "When comparing search algorithms, it is important to be aware of the constraints for any given problem, and select an algorithm based on those constraints. For example, certain implementations of hill climbing may result in rapid exit conditions. If the goal is to maximize number of problems solved (and local maxima are an acceptable result), Hill Climbing algorithms result in quick solutions that have some degree of \"optimality\".<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, preprocessing-heavy algorithms like contraction hierarchies offer incredibly low space costs (even more so when implemented with a bidirectional search), as well as rapid searches for guaranteed optimal solutions (if using Dijkstra). For high-volume usage implementations where preprocessing is not a concern (i.e. Uber), contraction hierarchies are a good choice. In fact, the `osrm` package that is used in this book is primarily based on an implementation of contraction hierarchies."
