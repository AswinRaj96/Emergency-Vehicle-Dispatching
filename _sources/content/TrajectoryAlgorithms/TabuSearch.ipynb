    "# Tabu Search\n",
    "\n",
    "Tabu search (TS) is an iterative neighborhood search algorithm, where the neighborhood changes dynamically. TS enhances local search by actively avoiding points in the search space already visited. By avoiding already visited points, loops in search trajectories are avoided and local optima can be escaped. TS can be considered as the combination of local search (LS) and memory structures. The main feature of TS is the use of an explicit memory. Uses of memory have two goals: to prevent the search from revisiting previously visited solutions and to explore the unvisited areas of the solution space.\n",
