# Introduction

This is the site for the book “AI Search Algorithms for Smart Mobility”. The book provides a comprehensive introduction to AI search algorithms and highlights the power of these computational techniques in 
solving ill-structured problems in the context of smart mobility. 

:::{note}
Topics to be covered include: graph search algorithms, metaheuristics, evolutionary computing methods, swarm intelligence algorithms, parallel and hybrid metaheuristics and graph neural networks.

Different case studies are discussed to show the ability of these cooperative and adaptive algorithms in solving complex continuous and discrete problems that arise in smart mobility systems and services. These case studies include, but are not limited to, multi-criteria optimal routing, emergency dispatch and routing for first response emergency vehicles, personal transporter planning, ridesharing, ride-hailing or ridesourcing, dynamic pricing, dynamic on-demand mobility services, multi-modal transportation planning, last-mile delivery systems using droids/cargo-bikes, deadheading problem, platooning or flocking and fleet management to name just a few.
